Data Scientist based in Munich. I'm interested in leveraging my experience in data science/analytics to produce actionable insights that improve business and products in an agile way. 

- I have a background in theoretical physics with significant research experience. Several scientific publications, with over 1500 citations in total [link](https://celis.github.io/files/list_of_publications.pdf), see also [inspire](https://labs.inspirehep.net/authors/1189874) or [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/a/celis_a_1.html) for more details. Multiple talks at international conferences, workshops and seminars [link](https://celis.github.io/files/conferences.pdf).   


- I am passionate about working with real-world data and building products with Machine Learning.  Experienced with the Python ecosystem. 


During my free time I enjoy working on side projects, sharing/teaching about data science, mathematics, and physics, as well as reading, watching films, and gardening. I grew up in Caracas, Venezuela.
