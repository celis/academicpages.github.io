Data Scientist based in Munich. I'm interested in leveraging my experience in data science/analytics to produce actionable insights that improve business and products in an agile way. 

- I have a background in theoretical physics with significant research experience. 

- I am passionate about working with real-world data and building products with Machine Learning. 

- Focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval problems. Experienced with the Python ecosystem. 

During my free time I enjoy working on side projects, sharing/teaching about data science, mathematics, and physics, as well as reading, watching films, and gardening. I grew up in Caracas, Venezuela.
